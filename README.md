# ML_Classifiers_ElasticScatteringPID
Telescopes of different Silicon detectors can be used to separate elastically scattered light nuclei (protons, deuterons, tritons etc) from each other. ML Classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) are implemented in this script to separate protons, deuterons and background randoms. Their individual performance is also compared.
